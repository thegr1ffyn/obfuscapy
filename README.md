```
Obfuscapy is a Python script designed to obfuscate Python payloads, making them undetectable to antivirus solutions. It's particularly useful for penetration testers and red teamers who need to evade detection while testing security measures.

## Features

- Automatically installs required modules.
- Works on both Windows and Linux platforms.
- Generates obfuscated payloads from input files.
- Utilizes advanced obfuscation techniques to bypass detection.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the script `obfuscapy.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide the path to your payload file.
5. The script will obfuscate the payload and save it as `stub.py` in the same directory.

**Note:** Avoid submitting the obfuscated payload to VirusTotal or similar services, as it may be flagged as malicious.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `colorama` (for Windows)
- `colored` (for Linux)

## Disclaimer

Obfuscapy is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Misuse of this tool for malicious purposes is strictly prohibited.
